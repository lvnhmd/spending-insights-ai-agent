# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Spending Insights feature is designed to help women and moms transform their complex financial data into actionable weekly insights that lead to tangible money wins. The system will analyze spending patterns, identify opportunities for savings, detect unnecessary fees, and provide personalized recommendations for starting investments. The goal is to make financial management simple, trustworthy, and rewarding through small, achievable weekly actions.

- **Technical Execution (50%)**: Well-architected solution using required AWS technologies
- **Functionality (10%)**: Working AI agents with scalable solution
- **Demo Presentation (10%)**: End-to-end agentic workflow demonstration

### Technical Requirements
- Must use AWS Bedrock or Amazon SageMaker AI for LLM hosting
- Must incorporate at least one of: Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, Amazon Bedrock/Nova, Amazon Q, Amazon SageMaker AI, AWS Transform, or Kiro
- Must demonstrate autonomous AI agent capabilities with reasoning LLMs
- Must integrate external APIs, databases, or tools
- Must be deployable on AWS infrastructure

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mom managing household finances, I want to easily import and categorize my spending data from multiple sources, so that I can get a complete picture of my family's financial habits without manual data entry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a CSV file of transactions THEN the system SHALL parse and import the data correctly
2. WHEN transaction data is imported THEN the system SHALL automatically categorize transactions using intelligent categorization
3. WHEN a user connects a bank account or credit card (stretch goal) THEN the system SHALL automatically import transaction data via mocked API for demonstration
4. IF a transaction cannot be automatically categorized THEN the system SHALL prompt the user for manual categorization
5. WHEN a user manually categorizes a transaction THEN the system SHALL learn from this input for future similar transactions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a busy mom, I want to receive personalized weekly insights about my spending, so that I can quickly identify opportunities to save money without spending hours analyzing my finances.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a week is completed THEN the system SHALL automatically generate a weekly spending insights report using EventBridge and Lambda for autonomous operation
2. WHEN generating insights THEN the system SHALL identify at least 3 actionable money-saving opportunities
3. WHEN presenting insights THEN the system SHALL show potential savings amounts for each recommendation
4. WHEN insights are generated THEN the system SHALL prioritize recommendations based on impact and ease of implementation
5. IF no significant insights are found THEN the system SHALL provide positive reinforcement about current spending habits

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user concerned about hidden fees, I want the system to automatically detect and alert me about unnecessary charges, so that I can eliminate wasteful spending and reclaim money.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing transactions THEN the system SHALL identify recurring subscription fees
2. WHEN a potentially unnecessary fee is detected THEN the system SHALL flag it for user review
3. WHEN presenting fee alerts THEN the system SHALL show the annual cost impact of each fee
4. WHEN a user confirms a fee is unnecessary THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on how to cancel it
5. IF duplicate charges are detected THEN the system SHALL immediately alert the user

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As someone new to investing, I want simple, educational investment information based on my spending patterns, so that I can learn about building wealth without feeling overwhelmed by complex financial products.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has consistent savings patterns THEN the system SHALL suggest educational investment simulations and information
2. WHEN providing investment information THEN the system SHALL clearly label all content as educational and not financial advice
3. WHEN presenting investment options THEN the system SHALL explain each concept in simple, non-technical language for learning purposes
4. WHEN a user explores investment information THEN the system SHALL provide educational resources and general guidance
5. IF a user's financial situation is unstable THEN the system SHALL prioritize emergency fund education over investment concepts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user who wants to stay motivated, I want to track my financial wins and progress over time, so that I can see the positive impact of my money management efforts and stay encouraged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user implements a money-saving recommendation THEN the system SHALL track the actual savings achieved
2. WHEN displaying progress THEN the system SHALL show cumulative savings over different time periods
3. WHEN a user reaches a savings milestone THEN the system SHALL provide celebratory feedback
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL highlight both small wins and major achievements
5. IF a user hasn't achieved recent wins THEN the system SHALL provide encouragement and easier action items

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want assurance that my financial data is secure and handled transparently, so that I can trust the system with my sensitive financial information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling financial data THEN the system SHALL use bank-level encryption for all data transmission and storage
2. WHEN processing user data THEN the system SHALL implement AWS Guardrails for PII redaction and data protection
3. WHEN storing user data THEN the system SHALL comply with financial data protection regulations
4. WHEN a user wants to remove data THEN the system SHALL provide easy data deletion options
5. IF there are any security incidents THEN the system SHALL immediately notify affected users with clear next steps

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a hackathon participant, I want to build an AI agent that meets all technical requirements and demonstrates autonomous financial analysis capabilities, so that the solution can be successfully deployed on AWS and judged according to the competition criteria.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL use AWS Bedrock or Amazon SageMaker AI for LLM hosting with Claude or Nova models
2. WHEN processing financial data THEN the system SHALL use Amazon Bedrock AgentCore for memory management and tool orchestration primitives
3. WHEN making financial recommendations THEN the system SHALL use reasoning LLMs with chain-of-thought prompting for multi-step autonomous decision-making
4. WHEN analyzing spending patterns THEN the system SHALL integrate real external APIs (Plaid sandbox, financial data services) and AWS databases
5. WHEN the system operates THEN it SHALL demonstrate autonomous capabilities including: automatic weekly analysis triggers, self-directed fee detection workflows, and independent categorization decisions
6. WHEN deployed THEN the system SHALL be fully functional on AWS infrastructure with proper architecture documentation
7. WHEN demonstrating the solution THEN it SHALL show end-to-end agentic workflow from data input to actionable insights with minimal human intervention

### Requirement 8
