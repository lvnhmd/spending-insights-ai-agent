# Deployment Notes

## Node.js Runtime Upgrade

**Date**: January 10, 2025  
**Issue**: AWS Lambda Node.js 18 End-of-Life Warning

### Problem
AWS sent notification that Node.js 18 runtime will reach end-of-support on September 1, 2025:
- No more security patches after September 1, 2025
- Cannot create new functions with Node.js 18 after February 3, 2026  
- Cannot update existing functions with Node.js 18 after March 9, 2026

### Solution
Updated all Lambda functions to use **Node.js 20.x** runtime:

#### Files Updated:
1. `infra/lib/spending-insights-stack.ts` - CDK Lambda runtime configuration
2. `src/lambda/*/package.json` - Node.js type definitions updated to v20
3. `src/lambda/README.md` - Documentation updated

#### Lambda Functions Affected:
- `spending-insights-transaction-processor`
- `spending-insights-weekly-generator` 
- `spending-insights-api-handler`

### Deployment Steps
1. **CDK Deployment**: Run `cdk deploy` to update Lambda runtime in AWS
2. **Verify Functions**: Test all Lambda functions after deployment
3. **Monitor**: Check CloudWatch logs for any runtime-related issues

### Compatibility
- Node.js 20 is backward compatible with Node.js 18 code
- All existing functionality should work without changes
- AWS SDK v3 fully supports Node.js 20

### Benefits
- Extended support until April 2026 (Node.js 20 LTS)
- Latest security patches and performance improvements
- Compliance with AWS Lambda runtime support policy

### Testing
✅ Local testing completed successfully with Node.js 20  
✅ All Lambda functions work correctly in mock mode  
✅ No breaking changes detected

### Deployment Results ✅

**Deployment Date**: January 10, 2025  
**Status**: Successfully Completed

#### CDK Updates:
- Updated CDK from v2.100.0 to v2.170.0
- Updated TypeScript from v4.9.4 to v5.0.0
- All dependencies updated successfully

#### AWS Deployment:
- ✅ CDK deployment completed successfully (57.96s)
- ✅ All 3 Lambda functions updated to Node.js 20.x runtime
- ✅ Lambda function test successful (200 response)
- ✅ CloudWatch logs confirm Node.js 20 runtime (`nodejs:20.v79`)

#### Verified Functions:
- `spending-insights-transaction-processor` → Node.js 20.x ✅
- `spending-insights-weekly-generator` → Node.js 20.x ✅  
- `spending-insights-api-handler` → Node.js 20.x ✅

#### Performance:
- Function execution working normally
- No runtime-related errors detected
- Memory usage: 68 MB (within 512 MB limit)
- Cold start: 166ms (acceptable)

### Compliance Status: ✅ RESOLVED
All Lambda functions now comply with AWS runtime support policy and will receive security updates until Node.js 20 EOL in April 2026.
